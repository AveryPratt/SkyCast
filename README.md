SkyCast queries both Google and Dark Sky apis to gather weather information for a particular time and location. It can accept a wide range of input, and returns a variety of different types of results. It leverages the aforementioned APIs along with a wide range of the .NET stack including ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, and Power BI to create organized panels and a sleek, informative dashboard to visualize the upcoming trends in weather.
